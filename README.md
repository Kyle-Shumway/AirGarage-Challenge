# AirGarage-Challenge

Both frontend and backend were built using node Node.js v14.17.0

to run either the front-end or back-end, open each respective folder in a terminal tab and run 
` npm install `
to install dependencies and 
` npm start `
to start the project

these are the unpaid liscense plates that are output.
